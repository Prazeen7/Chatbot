## WORKFLOW EXAMPLES
### Converting Art to Weavable Design:
1. File > Open (select image)
2. CarpeTools > Art to Graph
3. Set target colors (default:26)
4. Refine edges with Clean tools
5. Assign materials via Visualization

### Creating Geometric Pattern:
1. CarpeTools > Create > Checkerboard
2. Set dimensions (e.g., 20x20 knots)
3. Choose primary/secondary colors
4. Apply Handmade Effect for texture
5. File > Print Graph for production

## TROUBLESHOOTING
Color Distortion: Check "Maintain Aspect Ratio" in Resize
Missing Features: Verify .NET 3.5 SP1 installed
Performance Issues: Reduce design layers/complexity
Scanner Not Detected: Check WIA drivers
